# Additional Improvements

If I had more time, there are several more improvements I would make to this application.

- Rather than fetching all the data at once and then filtering on the client side, we should pass parameters to a query and only retrieve the data we desire. This plus pagination would improve page load times with massive datasets.
- If desired, add a home page or dashboard that links to this advocate search page and other areas of the application.
- More UI/UX changes
  - Paginate large data sets or implement infinite scrolling
  - Add responsive styling for mobile using Tailwind breakpoints
  - Table sorting
  - Make headers "Sticky" so they stay at the top when a user scrolls down through the list
  - Add a better loading skeleton or icon
